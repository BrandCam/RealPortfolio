      <p>
        Currently I am learning how to properly implement NoSQL Databases,
        create a PWA, and working on my animation abilities using canvas.
        Figuring out Atlas and querying in Mongo without using an ORM has been a
        real hurdle to be honest, but I'm sure that will change with more
        exposure to the ecosystem. For PWA's learning what service workers are
        and how to cash data correctly has been interesting. I think my biggest
        take away from using the canvas API has been how much I really needed to
        learn about the React library at a base level.Many Refs and closures
        later, I think I have a decent system going now.
      </p>

        Future goals are to start learning a second language. By learn I mean
        really learn the language. I've wrote small projects in Python and C,
        however writing one small text adventure game, and a web server from a
        tutorial do not equate to knowing a language. Writing a web server in C
        was probably the hardest bit of programming I have ever done, and that's
        with using a tutorial. I may not have gained much In terms of C writing
        ability, but I did take away one thing, the power of a very fast
        language. That is why my next language of choice is going to be RUST.
        RUST should give me enough hand holding with their excellent compiler
        and error messages ,and great support for WebAssembly to boot.
