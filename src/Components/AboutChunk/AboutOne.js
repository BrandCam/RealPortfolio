        Recently, I have been learning how to properly implement NoSQL
        Databases, create a PWA, and improve my animation abilities using
        canvas. Figuring out Atlas and querying in Mongo without using an ORM
        has been a hurdle. Using the canvas API in conjunction with React has
        shown me how important it is to know the React library well. Many Refs
        and closures later, I think I have a decent system going now.
      </p>

        My future goal is to learn a second language. By learn I mean deeply
        learn the language. I've written several small projects in Python and C,
        however writing one small text adventure game, and a web server from a
        tutorial does not equate to knowing a language. Writing a web server in
        C, even with the aid of a tutorial, was some of the hardest programming
        I have ever done. I did take away one thing, the power of a very fast
        language. That is why my next language of choice is going to be RUST.
        RUST should give me enough hand-holding with their excellent compiler
        and error messages, and great support for WebAssembly to boot.
