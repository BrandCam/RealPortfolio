      <p>See, much more impressive when data is more than just text.</p>
      <p>
        After graduating highschool in 2009 I decided to attend a tradeschool.
        Fast forward A year and a half and I get the pleasure of finding out
        that construction work pays much better than being a mechanic. So, I get
        a job working constructiion and for About 8 years that's what I did.
        Untill one day I woke up feeling sore and dreading going to work for the
        last time. I quit my Job in 2018, enrolled in a coding bootcamp and
        haven't looked back since. Not to say everythings been all sunshine and
        rainbows. Hard times have still happened between then and now, but I'll
        take a carrer that stimulates my mind and allows me to tackel complex
        problems over one that just breaks me anyday.
      </p>
      <p>If you're looking for an ambitious person...well you found him.</p>
