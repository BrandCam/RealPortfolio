      <h3>What drives me. </h3>
      <p>See, much more impressive when data is more than just text.</p>
      <p>
        After graduating highschool in 2009, I decided to attend a trade school.
        Fast-forward a year and a half and I get the pleasure of finding out
        construction work pays much better than being a mechanic. So I get a job
        working construction and for about 8 years that's what I did. Until one
        day I woke up feeling sore and dreading going to work for the last time.
        I quit my job in 2018, enrolled in a coding bootcamp and haven't looked
        back since. Not to say everythings been all sunshine and rainbows. Hard
        times have still happened between then and now, but I'll take a career
        that stimulates my mind and allows me to tackle complex problems over
        one that just breaks me anyday
      </p>
      <p>If you're looking for an ambitious person...well you found him.</p>
